   <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This series of posts is a miscellany of things which may be useful to others. It isn't restricted in scope. </p>
<p>Writing gives clarity of thought, and practice makes perfect when writing. </p>
<h2>Form</h2>
<p>Posts will be up to 500 words in length. Presentation and form of writing should be clear and concise. Posts should not attempt to convey too many ideas or too much information. </p>
<p>Posts are written in nvim using the markdown format, published in pelican, which is built using python. The output of pelican is controlled in git and pushed to a remote github site where it can be downloaded and read. </p>
